# Overview
The highly acclaimed book ["Why We Sleep"][1] faced criticism from the
scientific community, namely independent researcher [Alexey Guzey which 
identified a number of inconsistencies][2]. These were echoed by 
[Andrew Gelman][3] who also suggested a [response from Walker is needed][4].
    
Alexey Guzey reviewed the first chapter which took him 130 hours and
estimated the whole book would take over 3,000 hours.

There are likely hundreds of thousands of readers who are genuinely interested
in knowning the confidence as supported by research community behind all the 
facts presented in the book.  

Perhaps this could be achieved with the help of a larger community that could 
check the facts with the purpose to correctly inform the public.
